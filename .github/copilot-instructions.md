# Copilot Instructions for my-first-js-project

## Project Overview
- This is a beginner-friendly JavaScript project focused on learning and experimenting with core JS concepts.
- The codebase is organized by topic, with each subfolder (e.g., `OBJECT_ARRAY/`, `video17/`, `video18/`) containing an HTML file and a related JS file for hands-on practice.

## Key Patterns & Conventions
- Each topic folder contains:
  - An HTML file that loads the corresponding JS file via a `<script>` tag.
  - A JS file demonstrating a specific concept (e.g., arrays, variables, DOM manipulation).
- Code is written in plain JavaScript (ES5/ES6), no frameworks or build tools are used.
- There is no module system; all scripts are standalone and loaded directly in the browser.
- Variable and function names are simple and descriptive, matching the learning focus.

## Developer Workflow
- To run code, open the relevant HTML file in a browser (e.g., open `OBJECT_ARRAY/objectarray.html` to test `objectarray.js`).
- No build or test commands are required; this is a pure browser-based project.
- Debugging is done using browser DevTools (Console tab).

## Examples
- `OBJECT_ARRAY/objectarray.js` demonstrates array operations: declaration, indexing, updating, and pushing new elements.
- `video17/video17.js` and `video18/lab01.js` follow similar patterns for other JS topics.

## Integration & External Dependencies
- No external libraries or dependencies are used.
- All code is self-contained within the project folders.

## Guidance for AI Agents
- When adding new examples, follow the folder structure: create a new folder with both an HTML and JS file.
- Keep code simple, clear, and focused on illustrating a single concept per file.
- Do not introduce build tools, package managers, or frameworks.
- Reference existing files for naming and structure conventions.
